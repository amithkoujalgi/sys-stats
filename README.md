### Introduction

This Python package allows you to monitor various system statistics through a simple web interface. Whether you're a
developer, a sysadmin, or just curious about how your system is performing, this package makes it easy to access and
visualize system metrics.

### Why System Stats Web Interface?

One would definitely question -- "why develop another monitoring tool?"
Well, there are quite a few tools that I have tried but they either needed some effort to setup or lacked one or more
features.

While there are numerous monitoring tools available for different purposes, I needed a solution that was very simple. A
tool that's easy to
install, involves almost no effort to set up, and offers a simple and clean web UI for visualizing essential system
metrics.

PS: I'd appreciate if someone can point me to some good tools that suit the above stated goal! I'd be happy
to take a look at it.

The development of that thought, resulted in a tool that is:

- **Easy To Install:** Install the package using pip and get started with just a few commands.
- **Has a Web Interface:** Access system statistics through a simple, clean and user-friendly web interface.
- **Has Real-Time Monitoring:** Monitor CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and more in real time.
- **Has Cross-Platform support:** Compatible with various operating systems, including macOS, and Linux.

### For whom is this tool intended?

While this tool could be used by anybody who is interested in simple system monitoring, it is best
suited for developers or system admins or someone who wants to monitor a headless (remote server/non-windowed mode
server) computer which over a web interface.

### Where can I run this?

It can practically run on any system, and due to its lightweight nature, it can operate on computers with low resource
specifications.

Some of the use-cases:

- you can set it up on Docker containers which need to be monitored remotely.
- if you have multiple on-prem servers in a private network that need monitoring at individual host level, you can host
  this tool on each server and access it over web interface.
- you can run it on a Raspberry Pi (potentially?). Although I've not tested the tool on a Raspberry platform ðŸ˜…

The possibilities are endless and the tool will evolve over time to get better.

### Features

- List running processes
- List processes listening on inet ports
- Show hardware metrics - CPU/Memory usage, etc

### Installation

To install the package, use the following pip command:

```bash
pip install sys-stats
```

Note: 

> On MacOS, it might fail to install if you do not have `xcode` set up. Please set up xcode and continue with the installation. Meanwhile, I shall find a way to by-pass this step.

PyPI project: https://pypi.org/project/sys-stats/

Then run,

```bash
sys-stats start
```

The process starts up with the following logs:

```text
INFO:root:Starting web server on 0.0.0.0:8070
INFO:root:Web UI at: http://0.0.0.0:8070
(8606) wsgi starting up on http://0.0.0.0:8070
```

Now, access the web interface at http://localhost:8070

To specify a different port, run:

```bash
sysstats start --port 8055
```

### Development

#### Requirements

- macOS or Ubuntu or any other *nix distros
- Python 3.8+

#### Building from source

Run:

```bash
bash build.sh
```

This creates a wheel distribution under `dist` directory.

#### Areas of improvement

- Cache the data in memory to record resource utilisation for a given time period (for 30 mins, or more) - useful for
  plotting resource utilisation graphs.
- Security measures/user authentication
- UI improvements - look and feel and slickness
- Sorting table data by fields
- Settings view
- Ability to start the server in background (-d/--daemon mode)
- Ability to pass an external JSON/YAML configuration file to configure bind address, logging path, etc.
- Support for cluster setup (may be?)

#### Get Involved

Contributions are most welcome!
Whether it's reporting a bug, proposing an enhancement, or helping with code - any sort of contribution is much
appreciated.
